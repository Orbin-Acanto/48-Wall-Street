              This space has retained much of its original 1920&apos;s
              architectural detail; from the 30-foot ceilings to its beautiful
              Palladian windows. The Grand Mezzanine can host and accommodate a
              variety of events, which include seated dinners for 350 guests or
              a cocktail reception for 500 guests. The space can also be divided
              to your liking to create a more intimate setting for smaller
              events and meetings.
